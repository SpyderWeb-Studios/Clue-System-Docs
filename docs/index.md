# About 


This is the Clue System Plugin Documentation. Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress and will receive constant and consistent updates, especially as the more advanced features in our roadmap get implemented.

Roadmap: 
 - Rotating the Meshes
 - Refactoring the Clue Data Asset to be more expandable to include as many types of Clues, such as audio clips.
 - Refactoring the Clue Location to use Data Assets and support nesting

We will be looking to our community for ideas to add to this list, as well how our own needs with this system progress.
