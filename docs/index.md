# About 


This is the Clue System Plugin Documentation. Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress and will receive constant and consistent updates, especially as the more advanced features in our roadmap get implemented.

This plugin aims to enable everyone, designer or programmer, beginner or veteran, to design and implement 
a complex web of clues. We have developed an easy to use system with minimal setup that can support different
categories, revealing information based on what clues have been collected and both mesh and image clues. 

Please view our [Installation](/Getting%20Started/Installation) and [Quick Setup](/Getting%20Started/QuickSetup) guides
to see how to get started with our plugin. 



We will be looking to our community for ideas to add to our [Roadmap](/docs/Documentation/PluginRoadmap.md) as well how our own needs with this system progress.
