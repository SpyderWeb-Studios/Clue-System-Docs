# Plugin Roadmap

Current Features:

- Different Categories for Clues
- Single function call to collect a clue
- Asynchronous Loading of Data Asset
- Can select between using a Mesh Clue or an Image of a Clue
- Subsystem driven so clue management data can be retrieved from any object that needs it
- Event driven to improve performance


Roadmap:

* Rotating the Meshes
* Refactoring the Clue Data Asset to be more expandable to include as many types of Clues, such as audio clips.
* Refactoring the Clue Location to be User Defined Strings and support nesting by using multi dimensional arrays
