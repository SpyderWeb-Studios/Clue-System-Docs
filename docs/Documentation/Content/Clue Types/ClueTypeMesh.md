# Clue Type Mesh


This Clue Type is designed to be used with a Mesh as the inspection focus. It has a few custom members, like how far away from the Mesh should the Camera start to render the mesh, which [Inspector](/docs/Documentation/C%2B%2B/ClueSystem/GameFramework/ClueInspector.md) should be used and even has 2 different Mesh variables in case you have a higher resolution Mesh or entirely different Mesh that you want to display when Inspecting the Clue.
