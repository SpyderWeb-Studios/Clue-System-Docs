# PrimaryDataAsset_ClueConfig


This is the new way to organise the clues, as it is a quick, easy & intuitive method of constructing and visualising a tree of clue information. This method allows for nesting of potentially limitless number of categories, and a lot easier way of defining a category.

These Config files can be fed into the [Clue Setup Component](/docs/Documentation/C%2B%2B/ClueSystem/Components/ClueSetupComponent.md) to be used as the root node, or on other Config files to build up branches of clues or assigned in the [Clue Branch Manager Widget](/docs/Documentation/C%2B%2B/ClueSystem/Widgets/Managers/ClueBranchManager.md).
